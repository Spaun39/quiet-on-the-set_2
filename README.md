Prevent someone from turning up the volume on a Windows machine beyond a maximum volume

This is a very simple Windows Forms application that lets you set a maximum value on for your volume, and then lock the setting so that a user cannot change the volume.

*Disclaimer: This app is primarily geared toward young/special needs children. The "lock" provides a basic level of control, but it could be easily bypassed by someone with technical knowledge.*
